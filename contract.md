**CS225 Data Structures**


**Team Contract (kevinc17, jacobfp2, chiuyin2, davyji2)**


**Communication**
1. **Team Meetings**


Our team will meet every Sunday 11AM-12PM and Tuesday 1PM-2PM CST using discord. We will take turns taking notes for the Development Log in a shared google docs, in the order of chiuyin2, davyji2, jacobfp2, then kevinc17.


2. **Assistance**


Each team member can be contacted on Discord. We commit to answering messages within 48 hours.


3. **Respect**


The note-taker of the week will also serve as the project lead for the week. The note-taker should make sure everybody is able to speak and contribute to the project equally. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority. Everybody agrees to agree with decisions made even if they do not disagree. 


**Collaboration**
1. **Work Distribution**


Every week, deliverables will be determined by the entire team and each member can volunteer to choose which deliverable they would like to work on. If nobody volunteers, the group will meet and figure out who is able to work on the deliverable.


2. **Time Commitment**


Every member agrees to put in the necessary amount of time to finish their deliverable. If somebody is unable to complete a deliverable, then the member will ask in the group chat for any suggestions. If the member is still unable to complete the deliverable, then we will meet and try to switch tasks. 


If a team member is habitually not completing their deliverable, then they will be asked the reasoning and based on the answer the group may respond accordingly. 


3. **Conflict Resolution**


We will roll a dice online and whoever guesses it correctly is correct.
